#Assignment_Coding2022_Joao_Reis

This code represents the final assignment to the course of Coding for Economist, by JoÃ£o Reis, during the Winter Term of 2022 in Central Eurpean University.

The original data was taken from https://gabors-data-analysis.com/datasets/ , more specifically https://osf.io/zqm6c/. "The football data includes data on games and teams of the English Premier League, the top football division in England. The dataset covers 11 seasons: from 2008/2009 to 2018/19"

IMPORTANT:

-> In every code, make sure to change your directories. Also, in the do files (stata), there are two lines to create a new directory. If you already have it, do not run those lines (all the necessary instructions are commented on the .do files themselves).
